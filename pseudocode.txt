Processed data files to generate:
- overview with cols for richness and gini
- CSV(s) with number of cancer associated clusters
- cluster annotations for each patient of unique AA seqs
- indications of which ones of those clusters are cancer associated
- cluster labels for entire repertoire of combined tcrs

- csvs with conserved tcrs across treatment groups (i.e. clusters which share similarities between groups)
- csvs with conserved tcrs within each treatment group (i.e. clusters which 
share similarities between patients, broken down as a histogram of which are most represented in patient population)




1. Preprocess raw data TSVs to get multiplicities
- Initialize dict (to write to df)
- Initialize set (to keep track of unique AA seqs)
- Iterate through all TSVs
    - Iterate through each row in TSV
    - If AA not in set:
        - Add AA to output TSV with rest of 
    - elif aa in set:
        - add multiplicity to appropriate row in TSV



2. Preprocess overview (write metrics to preprocess TSV)
3. Compare
